# Tundra

Tundra is both a palette and a collection of colour schemes inspired by the
arctic tundra and the alpine landscapes of northern Scandinavia (as well as the
fantastic palettes [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and
[Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com)). It features a blueish grey to pale
yellowish orange base gradient with slightly muted accents and has the goal of
being relaxing for the eyes as well as the mind.

The accents form a 12-colour RYB colour wheel derived from CIE L*c*hÂ° gradients
between a small number of hand-picked colours (red, yellow, green and blue, to
be specific). Each accent colour also has a light and a dark variant, derived
from specific lightness and chroma relations. All in all, this makes for a
whopping 36 accent colours, not all of which should be used at the same time.
The colour schemes primarily use the medium shades.

## Status

The project is currently a work in progress. The initial version of the palette
is ready, but minor adjustments are still to be expected. Color presets for
Xfce Terminal are just around the corner, and will be followed by colour
schemes for vim and neovim. These will serve as references for other editor and
IDE themes.
